# Dynamics Web API Client

```
pip install dynamics-client
```

Client for making Web API request from a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Database.

You should also read the [Dynamics Web API Reference Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/query-data-web-api):

## Basic usage:
1. Init the client:     
```python
from dynamics import DynamicsClient

client = DynamicsClient(...)
client = DynamicsClient.from_environment()
```  
2. Set the table:
```python
client.table = "..."
```
3. Set row (Required for PATCH and DELETE, otherwese optional):
```python
client.row_id = "..."
```
4. Set query options (optional):
```python
client.select = [...]
client.expand = {...}
client.filter = [...]
...
```
5. Set headers (optional):
```
client[...] = ...
```

---

Make a GET request:
```python
result = client.GET()
```
Make a POST request:
```python
result = client.POST(data={...})
```
Make a PATCH request:
```python
result = client.PATCH(data={...})
```
Make a DELETE request:
```python
result = client.DELETE()
```

Remember to reset between queries:
```python
client.reset_query()
```

Query straight after client init to get a list of tables in the database.

##  Documentation:

### Client class methods an properties:

```python
from dynamics import DynamicsClient
```

#### *DynamicsClient(...)*

- api_url: str - Url in form: 'https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v{api_version}'
- token_url: str - Url in form: 'https://[Dynamics Token URI]/path/to/token'
- client_id: str - Client id (e.g. UUID).
- client_secret: str - Client secret (e.g. OAuth password).
- scope: List[str] - List of urls in form: 'https://[Organization URI]/scope'. Defines the database records that the API connection has access to.

Create a Dynamics client from the given arguments.

---

#### *DynamicsClient.from_environment()*

Create a Dynamics client from environment variables:

1. DYNAMICS_API_URL
2. DYNAMICS_TOKEN_URL
3. DYNAMICS_CLIENT_ID
4. DYNAMICS_CLIENT_SECRET
5. DYNAMICS_SCOPE

---

#### *DynamicsClient.request_counter: int → int*

How many request have been made by the client so far.

---

### Client instance methods and properties:

```python
client = DynamicsClient(...)
```

---

#### *client.GET(...) → List[Dict[str, Any]]*

- not_found_ok: bool = False - No entities found should not raise NotFound error, 
  but return empty list instead.
- next_link: Optional[str] = None - Request the next set of records from this link instead.

Make a GET request to the Dataverse API with currently added query options.

**Error Simplification Available**: This and the other HTTP-method -functions are decorated with a decorator, 
that can take some extra options: `simplify_errors` (If set `True`, will simplify all errors occurring
during the excecution of the function to just a single DynamicsException with a default 
error message) and `raise_separately` (A list exception types to exclude from the simplification,
if `simplify_errors=True`, so that they can be handled separately). These are useful when you want to
hide implementation details recieved in errors from frontend users.

---

#### *client.POST(...) → Dict[str, Any]*

- data: Dict[str, Any] - POST data.

Create new row in a table or execute an API action or function.

---

#### *client.PATCH(...) → Dict[str, Any]*

- data: Dict[str, Any] - PATCH data.

Update row in a table. Must have 'table' and 'row_id' query option set.

___

#### *client.actions: [Actions](dynamics/api_actions.py)*

Injected instance of predefined Dynamics actions. Calling methods under this property execute the actions 
without needing to use the POST, PATCH, or DELETE methods. It is recommended to read the 
[API Action Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/actions)
and how to [Use Web API Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/use-web-api-actions).

___

#### *client.functions: [Functions](dynamics/api_functions.py)*

Injected instance of predefined Dynamics functions. Calling methods under this property run the functions 
without needing to use the GET method. It is recommended to read the 
[API Function Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/functions)
and how to [Use Web API Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/use-web-api-functions).

---

#### *client.table: str → str*

Set the table to search in.

---

#### *client.action: str → str*

Set the Dynamics Web API action or function to use. Most of the time you don't need to set this, 
since you can use the `.actions` and `.functions` attributes to make these queries.

---

#### *client.row_id: str → str*

Search only from the table row with this id.
If the table has an alternate key defined, you can use
`'foo=bar'` or `'foo=bar,fizz=buzz'` to retrive a single row.
Alternate keys are not enabled by default in Dynamics, so those might not work at all.

---

#### *client.add_ref_to_property: str → str*

Add reference for this navigation property. This indicates,
that POST data will contain the API url to a matching row id
in the table this navigation property is meant to link to,
like this: `"@odata.id": "<API URI>/<table>(<id>)"`.

This should only be used to link existing rows. Adding references
for new rows can be done on create with this in POST data:
`"<nav_property>@odata.bind": "/<table>(<id>)"`.

---

#### *client.pre_expand: str → str*

Expand/navigate to some linked table in this table
before taking any query options into account.
This will save you having to use the expand statement itself,
if all you are looking for is under this table anyway.

---

#### *client.show_annotations: bool → bool*

Show annotations for returned data, e.g. enum values, GUID names, etc
by setting `Prefer: odata.include-annotations="*"` header.
Helpful for development and debugging.

---

#### *client.select(...) → List[str]*

- items: List[str] - Columns to select.

Set `$select` statement. Limits the properties returned from the current table.

---

#### *client.expand(...) → Dict[str, Optional[ExpandType]]*

- items: Dict[str, Optional[ExpandType]] - 
    What linked tables (a.k.a. naviagation properties) to expand and 
    what queries to make inside the expanded tables.
    Refer to the `ExpandType` TypedDict below on what queries are available,
    and what values they expect. Queries can be an empty dict or None,
    in which case no query Options are used.

```python
from typing import List, Dict, TypedDict, Union, Set, Literal

class ExpandType(TypedDict):
    select: List[str]
    filter: Union[Set[str], List[str]]
    top: int
    orderby: Dict[str, Literal["asc", "desc"]]
    expand: Dict[str, "ExpandType"]
```

Set `$expand` statement, with possible nested statements.
Controls what data from related entities is returned.

Nested expand statement limitations (WEB API v9.1):

1. Nested expand statements can *only* be applied to **many-to-one/single-valued** relationships.
This means nested expands for collections do not work!

2. Each request can include a maximum of 10 expand statements.
This applies to non-nested statements as well! There is no limit on the depth of nested
expand statements, so long as the total is 10.

---

#### *client.filter(...) → Union[Set[str], List[str]]*

- items: Union[Set[str], List[str]] - If a list-object, 'and' the items. If a set-object, 'or' the items.

Set `$filter` statement. Sets the criteria for which entities will be returned. It is recommended to read the 
[API Query Function Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/queryfunctions)
and how to [Query data using the Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/query-data-web-api).
You can input the filters as strings, or use the included `ftr` object to construct them.

---

#### *client.apply(...) → str*

- statement: str - aggregate, groupby, or filter apply-string.

Set the `$apply` statement. Aggregates or groups results. It is recommended to read 
[Aggregate and grouping results](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/query-data-web-api#aggregate-and-grouping-results)
and the [FetchXML aggregation documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/use-fetchxml-aggregation)
You can input the apply-statement as a string, or use the included `apl`-object to construct it.

---

#### *client.top(...) → int*

- number: int - Maximum number of results to return.

Set `$top` statement. Limits the number of results returned.
Default is to get the alphabetically first items, but `client.orderby(...)` can be used change this.

Note: You should not use `client.top(...)` and `client.count(...)` in the same query.
Also, using `$top` will override `Prefer: odata.maxpagesize=...` header preference setting.

---

#### *client.orderby(...) → Dict[str, Literal["asc", "desc"]]*

- items: Dict[str, Literal["asc", "desc"]] - Key indicates the column to order, and value indicates
  ascending (asc) or descending (desc) order respectively.

Set `$orderby` statement. Specifies the order in which items are returned.

---

#### *client.count(...) → bool*

- value: bool - If True, include the count (otherwise not included by default).

Set to True to include a `$count` statement. This adds the count of entities that match the 
filter criteria in the results. Count will be the first item in the list of results.

Note: You should not use `client.count(...)` and `client.top(...)` in the same query.

---

#### *client.pagesize: int → int*

Specify the number of tables to return in a page. 
By default, this is set to 5000, which is the maximum.
